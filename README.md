# Interactive Kanban Board Application - QuickSell Assignment:

This project is an interactive Kanban board built using React JS, designed as part of a frontend assignment for QuickSell. The application dynamically interacts with the provided QuickSell API to fetch and display ticket data. Users can group tickets in three distinct waysâ€”by status, user, or priority. Additionally, users can sort the tickets by priority (in descending order) or by title (in ascending order).

The Kanban board is responsive and designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a visually appealing and seamless user experience across devices.
